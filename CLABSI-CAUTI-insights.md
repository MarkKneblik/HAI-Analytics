# Geospatial Patterns

- CLABSI issues appear to be more widespread, affecting more total ZIP codes and a larger number of higher acuity ZIP codes compared to CAUTI.

- CLABSI issues are more evenly distributed among California, the Midwest, the South, and some Northeastern states, with higher acuity near the Mississippi River. Other
higher acuity areas are more evenly distributed further east of the Mississippi River.

- Puerto Rico is drastically worse with regards to CLABSI and combined average Standard Infection Ratio than all other areas in the US.

- CAUTI issues are more localized than CLABSI, primarily concentrated in the Midwest, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Northeast, with a few additional problem areas in the Pacific 
Northwest.

## Analysis

- In 2010, there were about 19,000 physicians in Puerto Rico, and in 2022, there were 10,846. Of the island’s municipalities, less than a third have hospitals with 
accessible beds. The combination of provider shortages and limited hospital bed availability plausibly increases time pressure during central line and catheter placement, raising the risk of 
deviations from sterile technique and infection control protocols. 

- Another reason for elevated CLABSI and CAUTI Standard Infection Ratios could be insufficient equipment and/or training when it comes to infection control. This was confirmed in a quality assessment project cited above. Most hospitals 
(84%) don’t have the right equipment to make sure endoscopes are disinfected properly, and no facility possessed a borescope, which is necessary to look for leftover debris or damage within endoscopes.
Only 1 in 3 staff members knew the proper guidelines for deciding how to clean and sterilize medical tools.  Only 10% of facilities had a water treatment system for sterilization 
and Immediate Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS) policies. I looked for specific infection-related audits for Puerto Rico (e.g., CLABSI bundle compliance audits, NHSN validation studies) 
but was unable to locate any territory-specific reports.

## Recommendations

- Support retention of medical staff through competitive compensation and loan repayment incentives to stem the physician exodus.
- Expand the scope and frequency of external audits (e.g., The Joint Commission) to ensure compliance with infection control standards, particularly in sterile processing departments.

## Analysis

- Midwest healthcare facilities report about 30–40% nursing staff shortages—nearly double national averages—particularly among small, low-occupancy facilities. This staffing strain plausibly increases time pressure during central line and catheter placement, increasing infection risk.
This data focuses on Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), not acute care hospitals, and does not directly measure procedural compliance or infection outcomes.
If hospital-level staffing shortages at similar scale exist, they may help explain elevated CLABSI/CAUTI rates. Infection bundle compliance data is not readily available.

- Nearly 8,500 out of 62,000 nursing positions in Michigan hospitals were vacant in 2023, causing problems in reduced services within hospitals. This plausibly makes 
maintenance of central lines and catheters an issue, as nurses have to take on larger workloads and prioritize higher acuity tasks.

- A survey conducted in Illinois from October of 2022 to February of 2023 showed that during their normal shifts, 32% of nurses cared for 6 or more patients at a time. Only 27% of nurses felt their patient ratios were "safe" or "adequate."

## Recommendations
- Mandate nurse-to-patient ratios at the hospital or state level to increase quality of care and ease nurses' workloads.
- Provide competitive compensation to fill nursing vacancies.
- Hire travel nurses with competitive rates to fill shortages.
